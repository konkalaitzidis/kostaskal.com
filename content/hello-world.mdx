I love long walks in nature.  
It is during these walks in silence and solitude that I reflect on life.  
The past.  
The future.  
Sometimes, the present.  
Usually, I reach some outcomes from these short walks but sometimes I don't.  
Both cases are fine.   
This being my first post I have to admit something.  
I started with having no idea what to write.  
No AI behind these words.  
Just pure mental blurb.  
And in my next pieces I aim to keep it like that.
